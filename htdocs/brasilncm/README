BRASIL NCM MODULE

NCM = Nomenclatura Comum do Mercosul (Common Mercosul Nomenclature) It is 
based on the first 4 digits of the Harmony System Codes. 

This module adds the ability to dolibarr erp to add customs code
based taxes. In Brasil the taxes of a product are specified by the NCM 
number wich is used to determine the category of a product.

product page where we will show the exact amount of each tax for that
single product.
